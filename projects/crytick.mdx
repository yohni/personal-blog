Crytick is a website that streams all crypto currencies prices every 2s.
The main idea of the project is to show the users the charts of cryptocurrencies which always updated every 2s. The charts will updated and sorted by the market cap value which always change every 2s. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. The styles was using daisyui that customed by tailwindcss.
